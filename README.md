# portfolio-java-spring-psql
A portfolio piece for Spring Boot / pSQL integration - currently following along with Marco Codes' Spring Boot Tutorial - Crash Course @ https://youtu.be/QuvS_VLbGko?si=kFf1FqUg350sKWdO


## Current takeaways
- Annotation features such as @GetMapping (specific form of @RequestMapping) and @RestController are useful to denote common CRUD functions (GET, PUT, POST, DELETE)

- @Service/@Component classes useful to store in-memory database items, which can then be initialized and called from @RestController classes
